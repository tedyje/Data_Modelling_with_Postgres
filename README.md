Song Dataset

The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.


Schema for Song Play Analysis

Using the song and log datasets, you'll need to create a star schema optimized for queries on song play analysis. This includes the following tables.
Fact Table

    songplays - records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong
        songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent

Dimension Tables

    users - users in the app
        user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level
    songs - songs in music database
        song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration
    artists - artists in music database
        artist_id, name, location, latitude, longitude
    time - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units
        start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday
